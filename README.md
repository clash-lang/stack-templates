# Stack Templates
Templates for `stack new` command. If you wish to alter a template, edit them in `projects/` and run `./render.hs`. To instantiate one the projects:

1. [Install Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/#how-to-install)
2. Run `stack new my-clash-project clash-lang/simple`. Replace `simple` by the template you'd like to use.
3. Read `my-clash-project/README.md`. Enjoy!

## Cabal users
All starter projects are also available on [clash-lang/clash-starters](https://github.com/clash-lang/clash-starters).
